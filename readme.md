### Trie ### 
<br>

* A tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. It is also called PREFIX TREE. 

* In a trie , each node represents an empty string , and the subsequent nodes nodes represent characters as you traverse down the tree.

* common prefix refers to the sequence of characters that is shared among multiple strings.

* common prefix are only stored ones.

* In conventional ds ike array we would have store all the strings repeatedly .but in case of trie it will tales the common prefix and store one's . so that's why it's stores and retrieves data's efficiently.
